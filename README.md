# Boston-Map-API

I will develop a single-page application featuring a map of my favorite places I would like to visit. I will then add additional functionality to this application, including: map markers to identify popular locations or places Iâ€™d like to visit, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a listview to support simple browsing of all locations. I will then research and implement third-party APIs that provide additional information about each of these locations with Yelp reviews. This app is usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.

To visit the app go to: [Boston-Map-API](http://bostonhuman.github.io/boston-map-api/).
Or run the app locally without Google Maps API key:
* In your terminal:
```
git clone

```
